# Read-Eval-Print-Loop
The Read-eval-print-loop or REPL is an interactive program that reads your code piecewise and evalutes it. It is quite similar to the Python or Ruby interpreter. The REPL is so named becuase in various LISPs it can be simply be implemented simply by `(loop (print (eval (read))))`.
