# 2.2 Exercises


1. Referring to documentation is something all developers do day in and day out. [Clojure Docs](https://clojuredocs.org/) is a community powered  documentation and examples repository for Clojure. Do keep it handy. As mentioned earlier, the `repl` allows you to refer to documentation without leaving the terminal. Try running `(doc println)` to see what the REPL to say about the `println` function.

2. We'll go to this soon but just to whet your curiosity, you can try seeing documentation of arithmetic operators eg `+`, `-`, `*` & `/`. Now you must be thinking that you surely don't need documentation to understand what these do, but if you look at the documentation closely, you will see something interesting.

3. What happens when you just type in "Hello, World" in the repl? Try this and see how it is different from `(println "Hello, World")`.
