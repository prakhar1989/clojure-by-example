# 2.1 In-Browser REPL

Are you on your employer's computer with no rights to install new software without permission? Or are you on a mobile device and you can't wait to try Clojure? Fear not, we have you covered.

Below what you see is a REPL that works (almost) similar to the one you run in the terminal. Go ahead and try typing `(+ 4 3)` in the REPL. Nice right?

{{ ../repl.md }}

Although there a few caveats in the REPL above, for the purposes of this guide it will suffice. In case a language feature in broken in the in-browser REPL, I will clearly point it out so that. For best experience, set up leiningen and a use the REPL as indicated in the previous chapter.

Go ahead and try playing with the REPL.
